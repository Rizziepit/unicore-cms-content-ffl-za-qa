Sharp\nmetal objects, machinery and rusty cans can cause wounds that can become badly\ninfected. **Families can reduce the risk of children's injuries from glass and\nsharp objects if they:** * keep glass bottles out of reach of young children\nand keep the house and play area free of broken glass and refuse * place\nknives, razors and scissors in drawers or locked cabinets well out of reach of\nyoung children * safely dispose of household refuse, including broken bottles\nand old cans. Other injuries around the home can be prevented by teaching\nchildren about the dangers of throwing stones or other sharp objects and of\nplaying with knives or scissors. Plastic bags should be kept away from young\nchildren to prevent suffocation. [For first aid advice on cuts and wounds,\nrefer to the end of this chapter](/content/detail/first-aid-advice/)\n\n",
