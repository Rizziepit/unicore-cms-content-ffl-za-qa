        "content": "Infectious diseases spread easily in crowded emergency conditions. To reduce\nthe risks: * ensure that all children 6 months to 15 years of age are\nappropriately immunized, especially against measles, at the first point of\ncontact or settlement * continue to seek health-care services to prevent and\ntreat illnesses. (Refer to the chapters on [Safe Motherhood and Newborn\nHealth](/content/detail /why-it-is-important-1/),\n[Immunizations](/content/detail/why-it-is- important-5/); [Coughs, Colds and\nMore Serious Illnesses](/content/detail/why- it-is-important-6/), and\n[Malaria](/content/detail/why-it-is-important-to- share-and-act-on-this-\ninformation/).) Malnutrition is more common in emergencies due to shortages of\nfood, increased disease and disruption of caring practices. It is therefore\nimportant to ensure that children: * breastfeed and receive adequate amounts\nof age-appropriate nutritious foods and drinks * receive micronutrient\nsupplements in addition to fortified foods. Children who are very thin and/or\nswollen (usually the feet and legs) need to be taken to a trained health\nworker or health facility for immediate assessment and treatment and further\nmanagement in accordance with their status. (Refer to the chapters on\n[Breastfeeding](/content/detail/why-it-is- important-3/) and [Nutrition and\nGrowth](/content/detail/why-it-is- important-4/).) n emergencies, lack of safe\nwater, sanitation and hygiene can cause disease that may turn into an\nepidemic. Cholera can occur where there is poor sanitation and overcrowding.\nBasic steps to follow include: * continue to wash hands frequently with soap\nand water or a substitute, such as ash and water * dispose of faeces and\ngarbage safely * practise safe food preparation * use safe water sources or\nemploy home-based water treatment, such as boiling, filtering, adding chlorine\nor disinfecting with sunlight * store safe water in clean, covered containers.\n(Refer to the chapters on [Hygiene](/about/hygiene/) and\n[Diarrhoea](/about/diarrhoea/).)\n\n",
