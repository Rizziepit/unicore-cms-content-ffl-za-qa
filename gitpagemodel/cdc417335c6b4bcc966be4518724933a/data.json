Children should be immunized at the recommended ages and should\nreceive subsequent doses at recommended intervals. When a child is immunized,\nthe health worker should record the vaccine, which dose it is (first, second,\netc.) and the date on an immunization or health card given to the parents or\nother caregiver. The immunizations should also be recorded and kept at the\nhealth clinic. It is important for the parents or other caregiver to keep the\nimmunization card and bring it with them the next time the child is\nvaccinated. With it, the health worker can record which vaccines the child has\nreceived and the date they were given. The healh worker can also provide\ninformation to the parents or other caregiver on vaccines that are missing or\nremaining.\n\n",
