Many are left with permanent\ndisabilities or brain damage. Injuries affect children of all ages. Girls and\nboys under 5 years of age are at particular risk. More boys than girls die\nfrom injuries. The most common injuries are traffic injuries, non-fatal\ndrowning (sometimes referred to as near drowning), burns, falls and poisoning.\nTraffic injuries and drowning are the leading causes of injury-related death.\nThe most common place for young children to be injured is in or around their\nhomes. Almost all injuries can be prevented. Families, communities and\ngovernments have an obligation to ensure children's right to live in a safe\nenvironment and be protected from injury.\n\n",
