Many are left with permanent\ndisabilities or brain damage.\n\nInjuries affect children of all ages. Girls and boys under 5 years of age are\nat particular risk. More boys than girls die from injuries.\n\nThe most common injuries are traffic injuries, non-fatal drowning (sometimes\nreferred to as near drowning), burns, falls and poisoning.\n\nTraffic injuries and drowning are the leading causes of injury-related death.\n\nThe most common place for young children to be injured is in or around their\nhomes.\n\nAlmost all injuries can be prevented.\n\nFamilies, communities and governments have an obligation to ensure children's\nright to live in a safe environment and be protected from injury.\n\n",
